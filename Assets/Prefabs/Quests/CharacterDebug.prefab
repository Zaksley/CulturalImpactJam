    name: Emma
    sentences:
    - "Hm\u2026 This isn\u2019t a fish."
    - Oh! Definitely not a fish. What are you doing in the ocean?
    - "Hm, not very chatty are you? Here, let\u2019s get you down and dry you off."
    - (Emma takes you back to her house, and dries you off)
    - There, all better now. I bet you're anxious to get back to your flock.
    - (You try to fly away, but crash to the ground)
    - "Hm? What\u2019s the matter?"
    - (You show her your wing)
    - "Ah, I see. You\u2019ve lost your flight feathers. You won\u2019t be going
      anywhere without those anytime soon."
    - "Well, don\u2019t fret. I was where you are once, and I had someone to pick
      me up when I was down. Now I can pay it forward."
    - (Emma gives you a red feather)
    - "Here\u2019s one of my feathers to start you on your journey. You\u2019ll need
      more than that one to start flying, of course. "
    - "But I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll figure it out - we all do in our own time. Maybe
      some of the others on this isle can give you some insight."
    - Just up behind my cottage is my good friend, Rava. Everyone here goes to her
      for advice.
    - "Good luck on your journey, little one. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be flying
      in no time. "
